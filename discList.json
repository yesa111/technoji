A simplified \"arcade\" version of the game was released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Arcade History mode featured exclusively in Tekken 5. Tekken 3 was the first game released on Namco System 12 hardware (an improvement over Tekken and Tekken 2, which used System 11). The game had a significant high energy gameplay and feel, which contributed to it being often considered the best game in the entire series by both fans and critics and one of the greatest games of its genre on the original PlayStation. It was the last installment in the Tekken series to be released for the original PlayStation; it was followed by the spin-off Tekken Tag Tournament and its successor Tekken 4 exclusively on PlayStation 2."

It is a direct sequel to Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, which was originally released for the Nippon Electric Company PC Engine (TurboGrafx 16) in 1993, in Japan. <br><br>The game was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo and published by Konami for the Sony PlayStation in 1997. It was re-released the following year for the Sega Saturn with additional features exclusively in Japan. In 2007, it was re-released in America for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade. The original PlayStation release was released for download on the PlayStation 3, playable on both that system and the PlayStation Portable (PSP). A complete port was also included in The Dracula X Chronicles for the PSP, featuring updated dialogues and bug fixes. In 2018, it was included in the Castlevania Requiem collection exclusive for the PlayStation 4. It was released on March 4, 2020 for mobile phones (iOS, Android); unlike previous \"metroidvania\" Castlevania titles released on mobile platforms, which were simplified versions, this is a direct port of the console game. <br><br>Although not very successful during its release in North America and Europe (only 60 thousand copies sold in each continent), Symphony of the Night has become highly sought-after by video game players and is widely considered to be one of the best and a milestone of the series.
